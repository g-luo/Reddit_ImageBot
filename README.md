# Reddit Image Bot

## Overview

A Reddit bot that searches for proper nouns in comment threads and replies with the first Google Image result. 
(Proper nouns are denoted by a series of words that start with an uppercase letter). 

## Motivation

Oftentimes Reddit comment threads will reference niche concepts and people (ex. String Theory, Grace Hopper) 
and users will spend a few minutes researching. This bot aims to improve the Reddit browsing experience by 
automating the search process via images. 

## Installation

As long as you have Reddit's PRAW and Google's BeautifulSoup packages installed, you can run the bot on your terminal! 

## Tests

Here are some example test cases.
